<h3 id="02242020">Six months in business, almost 100% uptime, 60.000 users and some changes</h3>
<pre class="newssigned text-left">-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256


* We have reached 6 months (with almost 100% uptime) and 60.000 users!

* Users can now change their PGP keys by themselves. Access to old key is required
before changes. Back up your PGP key and do not lose it. Treat it with the same
respect you treat your cryptocurrency wallets (or real wallets for that matter).
Except under very special circumstances if you lose access to your PGP key you lose
access to your account. If your key expired you won't be able to log in, however
you can contact us, sign a message with your old key and we will restore access.

Speaking of PGP: STOP using Igolder! You are basically GIVING your address to a
third party. If you don't care about that maybe you care about the fact that some
vendors cannot decrypt Igolder messages. Use a modern PGP client, most of them are
point and click.

* Order payment window has been increased to 120 minutes (two hours). That is more
then enough to make a payment. Payments received after the order is canceled may be
lost, so if paying by Bitcoin make sure you use a decent transaction fee. Stop paying
your orders from online wallets / exchanges. Send the coin to your local wallet first
because paying from online wallets / exchanges:
- - Is dangerous for your privacy.
- - Some of them add extra verification/delays and you won't make the 2 hour window.
- - Some use a ridiculously low transaction fee and the transaction will be delayed.
Transfer to your local wallet first and don't be cheap on the transaction fee. Late
payments create unnecessary support work and you may lose your coins.

* Order history and messages are now deleted after 45 days instead of 30.

* Users can edit feedbacks for 30 days after an order is finalized (escrow released).

* Added "Top 20 Vendors" based on number of sales and feedback.

* Added random sort to "Search".

* On "Your orders" page we added the exact time when the auto finalize can be extended
or the order can be disputed. On the order tab you will find a yellow box showing the
exact date and time when Dispute and Extend AF buttons will be available. 
Eg: "You can dispute/extend AF between 2020-02-28 18:44:51 and 2020-02-29 18:44:51 (UTC)"

* Added two new V3 mirrors:
3ffonw4wo7npl2rxld5dlhskesekyermcyickdtaa3ca3quindctnfqd.onion
flkzk2qjqe2yo5etsb7klxjihgrj7bi54k3iscccvkk7xbkif6x5etad.onion

* Bug fixes and stability improvements.

Thank you all for your business and support!

<h3 id="12212019">Some minor changes December 21 2019</h3>
<pre class="newssigned text-left">-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

* Added won/lost disputes to vendor stats.

* Added number of sales to vendor stats. Those are a bit obfuscated
and are shown as 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and so on, because some vendors
don't want their exact sales numbers made public.
Note: This feature has been introduced recently. Since we don't keep
order records for too long, some vendors may show lower sales numbers
then real ones. Orders older then ~ 40 days will not be added.

* All vendor reviews are now visible. Number of reviews does not equal
the number of sales so that shouldn't be a problem for vendors.

* Changed customer stats on the Login page: "Active" customers are the
ones who added a PGP key to their account, "All" are the ones who
registered (PGP ones included). We decided to allow customers without
a PGP key to browse listings, but nothing more. Maybe they find something
they like and decide to learn PGP. We also stopped deleting them.

* Details on how long we keep some data:

- - - Pending orders canceled for non-payment: deleted after 5 days. 
- - - Finished orders (canceled, canceled by staff, finalized): deleted after
15 days.
- - - Vendor sales records under "Your Earnings" page: deleted after 30 days.
- - - Messages (all of them, old or new): deleted after 30 days.
- - - Withdrawals and refund records: deleted after 30 days.
Note: For users who decide to remove their account, everything is deleted
immediately or their user name replaced by "[deleted user]".

* Added direct links for vendor info and vendor listings:
Vendor info: http://anymarketlink/vendor/vendorname
Vendor listings: http://anymarketlink/shop/vendorname

* Made some things more obvious, like order statuses.

* Added more automated messages on order status changes. 

* Some bug fixes here and there.

* Vendors please remember: You can set the auto-finalize timer for your
orders, and it starts at 5 days. If your FE application is denied
you can re-apply after some successful orders, and you won't have money
locked in escrow for too long. Your AF time is a bit randomized so an
adversary won't know exactly when you were online and marked the order
as "Complete". 

* Customers please remember: You can extend the AF timer or open a
dispute 24 hours before the timer expires. The timezone is UTC.
If you care about your orders keep an eye on them, don't let the 
timer expire and don't finalize your orders until you receive your
product. Also keep in mind some vendors don't work on weekends and
given this particular time of the year delays are to be expected. Before
opening a dispute try to sort it out with your vendor first.

* It has been brought to our attention that there are some phishing pages
impersonating us, thanks darknetlive for pointing that out. Check our
PGP key from multiple sources, check our signed canary / mirror list and 
if you are too lazy to check PGP signatures at least make sure your links
are from valid sources. As of now the only trusted sources for legit 
mirrors are:

 - Darknetlive: darknetlive.com / darknet7rl4epe24.onion
 - Dark dot Fail: dark.fail / darkfailllnkf4vf.onion
 - Our Dread sub: dreadditevelidot.onion/d/WhiteHouseMarket
 - Our Envoy sub: envoys5appps3bin.onion/index.php?board=136.0
(Sources are not listed in a particular order)
If you do get phished and you lose your money, there's nothing we can do
about it, so mirror checking is important.

* We will be working on holidays too, so if you need us we will be
around.

* Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everybody!

<h3 id="12142019">Changelog December 14 2019</h3>
<pre class="newssigned text-left">

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

* Added GBP, AUD and CAD. On the Gallery page prices will be displayed in all
supported fiat currencies.

* Added QR code on the payment page.

* Added email alerts. Only .onion addresses are accepted. Alerts are PGP
encrypted and everything works the same way as jabber alerts.

* Added animated PGP guides for several operating systems and clients.

* Receiver's PGP key name and email are shown on the send message/reply page. It will
make key lookup easier.

* Bug fixes, UI and backend improvements. UI is now more mobile friendly for users
who insist on accessing DNMs from mobile devices.

* Increased the order payment window to 90 minutes.

* Reached ~ 13500 users: ~1000 vendors, ~12500 buyers (~7000 added their PGP keys) and
~3800 active listings.


Only for buyers:

Since many buyers, against all recommendations, pay for their orders via exchanges
anyway, we thought of making things easier for you. Now you can pay for your orders
by Bitcoin, using a 3rd party exchange service.

Please keep this in mind:

* Bitcoin payments are processed via a 3rd party exchange service. We do not have
a BTC wallet and we are still XMR only. The order flow is: 
  1. You place your order and you get to the payment page.
  2. You will be given the option to pay by Bitcoin.
  3. If you choose to, you will be taken to an Exchange page.
  4. You send BTC to the exchange.
  5. The exchange sends XMR to your order address.
  6. Once everything is confirmed, your order is sent to vendor and the
difference refunded.

* This option is highly experimental, support for it is limited, may be
buggy and may be removed in the future. 

* You will be introducing a 3rd party into your transaction (the exchange). 
The exchange will know the BTC origin and the XMR destination. 

* This will be more expensive, as the exchange fees and rate fluctuation
need to be covered. The extra amount will be refunded either to
your XMR refund address or to your market wallet.

* Refunds are only sent out via XMR. We don't have a BTC wallet. So you will need
to learn how to use XMR, eventually.

* Use a decent Bitcoin transaction fee. Everything has to happen within
1 hour. If you send the payment too late your coins can be recovered but
you may lose money due to rate fluctuation.

* Save your exchange ID until your transaction is complete. If things go
wrong you may need it.

* Keep an eye on your pending order until it shows a status change (canceled,
refunded, sent to vendor). If the payment is sent too late and you contact
us within a reasonable amount of time, we can help you. If you contact us
more then 5 days later we can't help you, as we don't keep records
for too long. 90 minutes is more then enough for a payment to be sent,
and how you manage your payment is your responsibility.

* Bitcoin payments are not under our control. If we do get the XMR for
your order we can help you, otherwise we can't.

* Learn how to use Monero.

This option has no effect on vendor accounts.

Thank you for your business and Happy Holidays to everybody!

<li>Javascript warning: Javascript must be disabled in order to access

browser wide. If you use the "NoScript" plugin the Javascript error my 
be shown for a short time
until the plugin kicks in. This is normal and it should not be a 
concern, however we strongly recommend disabling Javascript browser 
wide:<br>
- Type "about:config" in your Tor browser address bar.<br>
- Search for "javascript.enabled".<br>
- Set it to "false".<br>

<li>Our goal is to create a simple user experience while maintaining a high level of security and anonymity. </li>
<li>Everything is written from scratch. No public market script.</li>
<li>Simple, intuitive design without unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
<li>Bug Bounty program.</li>
<li>Fast customer service. If we get overloaded, we will suspend

<li>The official language is English. We may also offer limited support in other languages.</li>
<li>Both Tor and I2P mirrors.</li>
<li>No withdrawal limits, except if the amount is lower then the network
 fee. In that case the withdrawal will be returned to your wallet.</li>
<li>5% fee for vendors, no fee for buyers. This is a flat fee for 
finalized orders only. No hidden fees, no deposit fees, no withdrawal 
fees. For high volume vendors, fee can be negotiated.</li>
<li>Vendors and us only operate using Monero, as Bitcoin lacks the 
required privacy and some users don't know how or neglect cleaning their

<i>Clarification: Our captcha doesn't have anything to do with Google's 
re-captcha, except maybe for the idea of using image recognition instead
 of "traditional" captchas. It does not have
any scripts of fingerprinting mechanisms whatsoever, it is plain

At the time of this writing we are the only market enforcing end to end 
encryption.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Important:</b> While our system allows exchange of encrypted files, pay special attention when receiving an attachment, <i>especially</i>
 if you never expected one! Verify the file and NEVER blindly
click/open everything you receive! This is also valid for random links! 
Getting your device compromised invalidates every security measure, 
yours and ours. If you receive
any unsolicited attachment or link, do not touch it and report it 
immediately !<br><br></li>
<li>We assume that any server can be hacked or seized eventually, so we don't want to keep more data our servers then we need to.</li>
<li>What is kept in plaintext:</li>
<ul>
<li>Listing information (title, description, pictures, price, shipping).</li>
<li>User names.</li>
<li>Sign in logs (for limited time).</li>
<li>Limited order information history, including vendor, buyer, order totals.</li>
<li>Limited feedback information.</li>
<li>Monero deposit and withdrawal addresses (for limited time).</li>
<li>Generic admin messages (for limited time).</li>
<li>Message subjects (both between users and support tickets,for limited time).</li>
<li>Public PGP keys.</li>
<li>Jabber/XMPP addresses used for notifications.</li>
<li>Email addresses used for notifications.</li>
</ul>
<li>What is kept encrypted:</li>
<ul>
<li>Messages between users (end to end encrypted, kept for a limited time).</li>
<li>Messages between users and admins (end to end encrypted, kept for a limited time).</li>
<li>Support tickets (end to end encrypted, kept for a limited time).</li>
<li>Message attachments (end to end encrypted, kept for a limited time).</li>
<li>Order details (shipping / delivery info or notes, kept for a limited time).</li>
<li>User passwords.</li>
</ul>
<li>If a user decides to close his account, all information related to that specific user/account will be purged.</li>
<li>No PGP private keys are kept on the servers.</li>
<li>No Monero private keys are kept on the servers.</li>
<li>Main wallet is only kept offline. Because of this, we verify/process
 all withdrawals in batches, within 24 hours, usually much faster.</li>
<li>We take periodic backups of databases, including wallets, orders, attached files.</li>
<li>Those measure ensure that even in the event our servers are compromised/seized:
<ul>
<li>No plaintext messages will be recovered.</li>
<li>No coins will be seized.</li>
<li>The attacker can only view the wallet balance, but he will not be able to transfer any funds.</li>
<li>We can be up and running in no time, and no order information will be lost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>For active, high volume users (both vendors and buyers):</b>
<ul>
<li>We will give you a dedicated, authenticated .onion domain.</li>
<li>This way, if our public mirrors are getting DDOS-ed, you will still be able to access your account and do business.</li>
<li>We are also considering giving dedicated, authenticated domains to 
every active user (any user that has made at least a deposit or sale), 
this way a determined DDOS-er
will not disturb our business, at least not too much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Messages will be deleted after 45 days (unread messages included).</li>
<li>Sent messages are not saved. If you need them, you need to save them locally.</li>
<li>Time zone is UTC, 24 hour time format.</li>

<ul class="text-justify">
While we go to great lengths trying to protect our users and ourselves, please keep in mind:<br><br>
<li>Learn how to use PGP and especially how to protect your private 
keys! While PGP is widely used for encryption and signing, it has a few 
limitations:</li>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to use. We provide a limited tutorial but we won't 
cover every OS / OS version in existence. There are lots of tutorials 
online. </li>
<li>It has some nasty denial or service vulnerabilities 
(https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f), 
importing a wrong key can wipe out your keyring or worse.
Do not import keys from public keyservers and backup your keyring often!
 </li>
<li>It does not support PFS (Perfect Forwarding Secrecy). Meaning if 
someone steals your private key, every message you ever received can be 
decrypted!</li>
<li>In the long run we plan on replacing PGP with something better and easier to use.</li>
<li>Protect your keys!</li>
</ul>
<li>Protect your OS. We recommend against using the same computer / OS 
for both darknet activity and clearnet stuff. In fact we recommend using
 Tails from a bootable USB stick
with persistent storage for storing your keys/wallets or for more 
advanced users something like Whonix with Qubes. If that is not 
possible/practical at least use an up to date OS, not used
for anything else.</li>
<li>Use full disk encryption! Never access any market before encrypting your whole disk!</li>
<li>If accessing a darknet market from an Android device, make sure that:</li>
<ul>
<li>The device is supported and is running the latest Android version (Android 10 at the time of this writing)</li>
<li>Your device has the latest security patches.</li>
<li>You run Tor browser and OpenKeychain (for PGP) in an isolated profile, separated from everything else.</li>
<li>Only use an Android device if you know what you are doing!</li>
</ul>
<li>Mind your OPSEC both online and while sending/receiving packages. 
Handwriting can be analyzed and attributed to a person, some printers 
use microdots that can identify a specific printer.
You can find a lot of information about privacy and OPSEC while 
searching online.</li>
<li>Do not keep Monero (or other currency) in custodial wallets like Coinbase. If you do not control your private keys, it's not <i>your</i> coin. Coinbase was given as an example,
every custodial wallet / exchanger is the same.</li>
<li>Do not keep any shipping information for longer then you have to, 
including but not limited to addresses / envelopes / packages / shipping
 labels.</li>
<li>If a tracking number is provided, do not track the package using 
your home internet connection or your phone, because if the shipment 
gets intercepted you will lose plausible deniability.</li>
<li>Do not reuse usernames/passwords/PGP keys over multiple darknet 
markets. While for vendors wanting to maintain their reputation this 
could be difficult, it shouldn't be a problem for buyers.</li>
<li>Under any circumstances do not use on darknet any username / 
nickname / moniker / password / PGP key that you may use or may have 
used on the clearnet or in real life, not even something
similar! It's the fastest way to get caught!</li><br>
Those details are beyond our control, and they are solely your responsibility.

We have added a private jabber server for market users. The server is 
only reachable via Tor and s2s is not enabled, so you can only 
communicate to other market users and market admins.
End to end enncryption is enforced,
so please use either OMEMO (recommended), OTR or PGP encryption. 
Plaintext communication is forbidden.
When you register and add your PGP key, a jabber user is automatically 
created for you. To activate your jabber user, go to your account and 
click "Change jabber password". You can choose
any password you want, but we strongly recommend using different 
passwords for different tasks. You do not have to use your jabber 
account if you do not want to, but jabber alerts to outside
servers will be phased out for both security and usability issues.<br><br>

<ul class="text-justify">
While customers can pay by Bitcoin if they choose to, our market only 
handles Monero. This is not a complete Monero user guide but merely some
 recommendations for new users.<br>
- We strongly advise against sending coin from an exchange to the market
 or using an exchange address for refunds as this is a serious opsec 
error,
it may not work or you may lose your coin. Some exchanges add a payment 
ID to their address and this is not supported. <br>
- We strongly advise against using a web or online wallet. Only use 
local wallets to store your coins. Remember, if you don't control the 
private keys,
it's not your coin. Web wallets may decide to lock your account, request
 KYCs or simply decide to steal your money. This applies to every 
cryptocurrency not just
to Monero. So again: use a local wallet.<br>
- Save your recovery details in a safe place, in a scrambled / encrypted
 format. If something goes wrong (disk crashes or similar) you can 
restore your
wallet and recover your coin.<br><br>
- Recommended wallets:<br><br>
<li>Linux, Windows, Mac: The official Monero client from https://web.getmonero.org/downloads/ (clearnet link).</li>
<li>Android: Monerujo from https://github.com/m2049r/xmrwallet, https://www.monerujo.io (clearnet links), also available on FDroid.</li>
<li>IOS: Cake Wallet from https://cakewallet.io/ (clearnet link)</li>
<small>We advise against using a mobile phone/tablet for dark net 
activities if you don't really know what you are doing. Unless properly 
secured
mobile devices are a security and privacy nightmare.</small><br><br>

Depending on how serious a bug is, your work will be compensated. While 
you won't be able to steal any money or sensitive

<span class="badge"> Rules </span>
</div>
<div class="panel-body infobody">
<br>
<li><b>Rules for buyers:</b>
<ul class="text-justify">
<ul>
<li>Do not try to scam vendors.</li>
<li>Do not use the messaging system to send unsolicited links or attachments.</li>
<li>Read the listing carefully and pay attention to the listing's terms 
and conditions. If something is not clear, contact the vendor before 
ordering.</li>
<li>When it comes to physical items, check the vendor's delivery time 
frame, and communicate with the vendor before opening a dispute. Most 
vendors will resolve their issues without getting
support involved.</li>
<li>While we are confident that most vendors are honest and just want to
 make a living, there will always be some bad apples. In this case, you 
can open a dispute.</li>
<li>You should start a dispute if:
<ul>
<li>vendor accepts an order and then does not deliver within the advertised time frame, does not answer, etc.</li>
<li>For physical items, if the item is not received, is substantially different from the listing or it is incomplete and/or damaged.</li>
<li>For digital items, if the item does not match the description or the
 listing is misleading. We do approve all listings manually, however 
some bad ones may slip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should NOT start a dispute if:
<ul>
<li>The quality of the product does not match your expectations (subjectively).</li>
<li>You do not know how to use the purchased product (either physical or digital).</li>
<li>The digital product you bought does not work <i>for you</i>.</li>
<li>You reason for dispute is in contradiction with listing's terms and conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not release money from escrow until you received your product 
(physical or digital)! We do not recommend "finalize early". If you have
 traded with the vendor before you can do what
ever you want, <i>on your own risk</i>. By hitting the "Release" button you lose the right to a dispute, so think before you click. You have been warned.</li>
<li>Don't be an asshole.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Rules for vendors:</b>
<ul class="text-justify">
<li>Do not try to scam buyers.</li>
<li>Do not use the messaging system to send unsolicited links or attachments.</li>
<li>Unacceptable listings:
<ul>
<li>No child or animal pornography.</li>
<li>No murder for hire.</li>
<li>No human or animal exploitation/abuse.</li>
<li>No terrorism related products, services or propaganda.</li>
<li>No weapons (less-then-lethal weapons included), explosives or poisons.</li>
<li>No tutorials, no "get rich quick" schemes. Most of those are low 
effort and have no real value. We do not even have a "tutorials" 
category, however if you have something
great that may impress us we <i>may</i> make exceptions.</li>
<li>No Fentanyl or similar substances.</li>
<li>No transfers (Pay $300 get $1000 via Western Union) kind of stuff.</li>
<li>Nothing that our administrators can consider unacceptable, at our own discretion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acceptable listings:
<ul>
<li>Almost anything else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All new and some modified listings go to moderation. We may reject a listing with or without an explanation.</li>
<li>Do not keep in your wallet more coins then you need, we don't want 
to hold your money for more time then we have to. There are no limits on
 withdrawals.</li>
<li>Describe your product as accurately as possible. Misleading listings are not accepted.</li>
<li>Emoticons, html tags, unicode or weird characters are not accepted neither in title nor in description.</li>
<li>No external links or contact information in your listing description
 or profile. Ignoring this rule will get your account permanently or 
temporarily banned. No wickr, no jabber, no email, no links.</li>
<li>Add your Terms and Conditions, Refund/Reship Policy either to your 
profile or your listings. Different listings/products may have different
 policies.</li>
<li>If adding a photo to your listing, make sure that's a photo of <i>your product</i>. You can put a paper note next to your product when taking the photo, stating your username,
but be careful as handwriting can be used to identify you and some printers add microdots.</li>
<li>Before you add a picture, make sure you strip the EXIF data as it 
can include information about camera and even location information. Both
 phones and cameras do it, so this is important.</li>
<li>Process your orders in a timely manner, and try to respect the advertised delivery deadline.</li>
<li>Keep the buyer informed every step of the way.</li>
<li>When selecting "auto-finalize" time, make sure it reflects your 
estimated delivery time. As a vendor your have a pretty good idea how 
long does it take for delivery.</li>
<li>Before contacting support about a dispute, try to solve it with the buyer first.</li>
<li>Breaking any of those rules will get your account temporarily or permanently banned.</li>

<li>If you find something you like:<br>
- Check the listing carefully, and pay attention to listing's terms and shipping information when dealing with physical goods.<br>
- Check the prices, including shipping. Prices are listed in fiat 
currency, but you will pay in Monero at the current exchange rate.<br>
- Check vendor's last activity time, rating and reviews.<br>
- We do not offer automatic discounts at the moment, however you can 
contact the vendor and ask for a custom listing if he agrees to a 
discount.<br>
- View and import vendor's PGP public key.<br>
- Select desired quantity and shipping method.<br>
- If you do not add a refund address and you do get a refund, it will be
 deposited into your market wallet. You can use those funds as a total 
or partial
payment for future orders or you can withdraw.<br>
- Write a short message to the vendor. Messages have to be locally encrypted (and preferably signed) before sending.<br>
- After hitting "Place Order" you will be shown an Order Status page. 
There you will find a Monero address unique to this order. The address 
is encrypted and signed. If you have
money in your market wallet it will be used for either a total or a 
partial payment. If your balance won't cover the order you will only 
have to send the missing amount.<br><br>
- <b>Important</b>:
<ul>
<li>Send the exact order amount to that address.</li>
<li>The payment requires at least 1 confirmation within 120 minutes. By 
not having at least one confirmation within the 120 minute window you 
may lose your coin.</li>
<li>Address is unique to the order. Trying to re-use that address and you <i>will</i> lose your coin.</li>
<li>If you place multiple orders, you need to send multiple payments to 
multiple order addresses. Do not try to combine payments, it will not 
work.</li>
<li>If you send less then the required amount, the order will be cancel and a refund will be issued.</li>
<li>If you send more then the required amount, the difference will be refunded.</li>
<li>If, by the time the payment is confirmed, something goes wrong with 
the listing (out of stock, vendor deleted listing) your order will be 
canceled and you will be refunded.</li>
<li>If you don't send any payment, your order will be canceled.</li>
<li>The vendor will not "see" the order until payment is confirmed (10 network confirmations).</li>
<li>Do not include a payment ID.</li>
<li>Do not send the payment from an exchange. While that will work, it is <i>very bad for your OPSEC</i>, the amount may be different or payment may be delayed.</li>
<li>Make sure the refund address belongs to a wallet you control. Exchange wallets or payment ids should not be used.</li>
<li>Just like withdrawals, refunds to external addresses will be 
processed within 24 hours, usually much faster. Refunds to market wallet
 are instant.</li>
</ul><br><br>
- After you sent the payment, you can refresh the "Order Status" page for updates.<br>
- If you log out or close the browser, you can find the order under "Your Orders" page, "Orders waiting for payment" section.<br>
- After your payment is confirmed (10 network confirmations) your order will be sent to the vendor.<br>
- If the vendor does not accept the order within 4 hours, you can cancel it.<br>
- After a vendor marks the order as "Complete" <i>pay attention to auto finalize date and time</i>. You can only dispute or extend the auto-finalize time 24 hours before auto-finalize,
so make sure you keep an eye on your orders as the exact time window for disputes / extend AF is clearly shown in the order tab.<br>
- Before disputing an order, please observe our rules. If you lose a 
dispute, administrators may give you a negative rating/feedback.<br>
- Keep in mind after a dispute is opened the other party has 72 hours to
 respond. We will not take any decision before this time is up, so 
please do not ask us.<br>
- Remember to finalize your order <i>after</i> receiving your product/service. Failure to finalize can get you a bad rating/review.<br>
- While finalize-early (FE) is accepted, it is not encouraged. FE should
 only be used if you really trust the vendor (you have traded before), 
after you release the coin
we cannot help you. Think before you click!<br>
- Rate the vendor after an order, to help keeping the community safe.<br>
- You can edit your feedback 30 days after an order is released / finalized.<br><br>

<b>Paying by Bitcoin (Dangerous)</b><br>
<ul class="text-justify">
<li>Bitcoin payments are processed via a 3rd party exchange service. We 
do not have a BTC wallet and we are still XMR only. The order flow is 
like this:<br>
1. You place your order and you get to the payment page.<br>
2. You will be given the option to pay by Bitcoin.<br>
3. If you choose to, you will be taken to an Exchange page.<br>
4. You send BTC to the exchange.<br>
5. The exchange sends XMR to your order address.<br>
6. Once everything is confirmed, your order is sent to vendor and the
difference refunded.</li>
<li>This option is highly experimental, support for it is limited, may be
buggy and may be removed in the future.</li>
<li>You will be introducing a 3rd party into your transaction (the exchange). The exchange
will know the BTC origin and the XMR destination. </li>
<li>This will be more expensive, as the exchange fees and rate fluctuation
need to be covered. However, the extra amount will be refunded either to
your XMR refund address or to your market wallet.</li>
<li>Refunds are only sent out via XMR. We don't have a BTC wallet. So you will need
to learn how to use XMR, eventually. It's not hard at all.</li>
<li>Use a decent Bitcoin transaction fee. Everything has to happen within
2 hours. If you send the payment too late your coins may be recovered but
you may lose money due to rate fluctuation.</li>
<li>Save your exchange ID until your transaction is complete. If things go
wrong you may need it.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your pending order until it shows a status change (canceled,
refunded, sent to vendor). If the payment is sent too late and you contact
us within a reasonable amount of time, we can help you. If you contact us
more then 5 days later we can't help you, as we don't keep records
for too long. 120 minutes is more then enough for a payment to be sent,

- Do not include any off site communication methods (jabber, wickr, 
email) netiher in the listing description nor in your profile. If you 
want to send your contacts
to your customer you can do that via encrypted messaging, but not via 
public listings.<br>
- Select shipping origin and destination, available quantities, measurement units, prices, etc.<br>
- Fiat prices have to be integers, no cents (.99) nonsense.<br>
- Add shipping methods. If selling digital goods/services, shipping is not required.<br>
- If you do not login to your vendor account within 5 days and you do 
not have notifications enabled (email or jabber) you will be set to 
vacation mode and your listings
deactivated.<br>
- Add up to four pictures. Maximum picture size is 5 megabytes, the gallery thumbnail will be generated from the first image.
For physical items, pictures are required.<br><br>
</li>
<li><b>Established vendors can apply for FE. To do so, log in and click "FE Application" under the user drop-down menu.</b><br>
- Some of you may have already been approved, to see your FE status check admin messages or go to your account page.<br>
- Not everybody will be accepted. We won't publish the exact 
requirements for approval, however however you have to be an established
 vendor with FE on at least one
active market. <br>
- Customer can still cancel the order if you do not accept it within 4 hours, and you can cancel/refuse an order.<br>
- Since we don't have a "hot wallet", coins will still be stored in the market wallet until you withdraw.<br>
- If there are issues with the order, refunds / reshipments are to be arranged directly with the customer.<br>
- If you receive complaints, your FE privileges may be revoked.
<br><br></li>
<li>If selling digital goods, you can either send them to the buyer as a
 message, or attach them as a file. Attachments must be encrypted with 
the buyer's public key before sending.<br><br></li>
<li>We do not offer automatic discounts at the moment, however you can always create custom (private) listings.<br><br></li>
<li>We do not offer sorting by vendor's rating nor featured listings at 
the moment, because we want to give all vendors equal opportunity to do 
business.
We may add an option for featured listings at some point. However buyers
 can check a vendor's rating themselves.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>If you receive a dispute remember to contact staff and 
respond to that dispute. If we are not contacted within 72 hours we will
 rule in customer's favor.</strong><br><br></li>
<li>You can choose to either accept or cancel an order. If canceling, it's recommended to message the buyer and explain why.<br><br></li>
<li> Please check your stock / order message / policies BEFORE accepting
 an order or marking it as Complete / Shipped. If for any reason you 
cannot fulfill an order (you don't ship to customer's
country etc) cancel the order before accepting it. Asking us to cancel 
an order you accepted will count as a lost dispute. You can access the 
order message from within the order tab.<br><br></li>
<li>If you do not accept an order within 4 hours, the buyer has the option to cancel.<br><br></li>
<li>When you ship the order (or otherwise deliver it) you can mark it as complete.<br><br></li>
<li>When marking the order "complete", you will be asked for an 
estimated auto-finalize time between 5 and 45 days. Make sure this is as
 close to reality as possible.<br><br></li>
<li>To issue a partial refund, move your mouse over the "Order Total" box and click "Issue partial refund". <br><br></li>
<li>Rate the buyer after an order, to help keeping the community safe.<br><br></li>
<li>You can edit your feedback 30 days after an order is released / finalized.</li>

<li>Our market is focused on security, so PGP is a must. PGP two factor 
authentication is enabled site wide for vendors and on all pages
except welcome page for buyers. We have no mnemonic, no pin and no other
 password recovery mechanism except PGP. Back up your PGP key and do not
 lose it. Treat it with the same
respect you treat your cryptocurrency wallets (or real wallets for that 
matter).
Except under very special circumstances if you lose access to your PGP 
key you lose
access to your account. If your key expired you won't be able to log in,
 however
you can contact us, sign a message with your old key and we will restore
 access.</li>
<li>Do not use obsolete PGP software or services like igolder. You are basically GIVING your address to a
third party. If you don't care about that maybe you care about the fact that some
vendors cannot decrypt Igolder messages. Use a modern PGP client, most of them are
point and click.</li>
<li>To change your PGP key you will need to have access to your old key.</li>
<li>We have some animated GIFs on relevant pages covering some PGP clients and operating systems. While
we cannot cover all operating systems and PGP clients, there are lots of resources on that, check the "Useful Resources" tab.</li>

<span class="badge"> Important information about payments, withdrawals and refunds</span>
</div>
<div class="panel-body infobody">
<strong>Payments</strong><br><br>
<ul class="text-justify">
<li>
Payment address is unique for each order. If you send twice to the same address <i>you will lose your coin</i>.
</li>
<li>
Payment must be received within 120 minutes after you order (at least 1 
network confirmation). After 120 minutes your order will be canceled. If
 paying by Bitcoin use a decent transaction fee.
If your payment is received later then 120 minutes make sure you contact
 us within 5 days and we may recover your coin, otherwise there is 
nothing we can do. <br>
Remember: 120 minutes refers to the time we receive your payment not the
 time you send it. Have the coin in your wallet before ordering.
</li>
<li>
Do not pay your orders from online wallets / exchanges. Send the coin to your local wallet first because:<br>
- It is dangerous for you.<br>
- Some of them add extra verification/delays and you won't make the 2 hour window.<br>
- Some use a ridiculously low transaction fee and the transaction will be delayed.<br>
Transfer to your local wallet first and don't be cheap on the 
transaction fee. Late payments create unnecessary support work and you 
may lose your coins.<br>
</li>
<li>
When contacting support about a payment include order id, transaction 
id/hash or exchange ID if you paid by Bitcoin. We cannot help you 
without this information and your ticket will be ignored.
</li>
<li>
99% of our users have no problem following those guidelines. Disregard them and you will most likely lose your coins.
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Withdrawals and refunds</strong><br><br>
<ul class="text-justify">
<li>
Refunds to market wallets are instant.
</li>
<li>
Withdrawals and reunds to external addresses:
</li>
<div class="alert alert-danger text-left"><strong>Please remember:</strong><br>We
 do not have a hot wallet, all withdrawals are checked and processed 
offline. This can take up to 24 hours. So if you
don't receive your withdrawal 10 minutes after you requested it, don't 
panic, it's just the way the system works. Sometimes withdrawals are 
indeed processed within minutes, but that's not a rule.
Contact support about withdrawals if: <br>- 24 hour pass and your withdrawal is still "Pending"<br>
- Your withdrawal is "Processed" but you did not receive your coin.<br>
Otherwise you will be just creating unnecessary support tickets that 
won't speed things up. Up to 24 hours is the way the system works.<br>
Thank you for understanding.</div>
